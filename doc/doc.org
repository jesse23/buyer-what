Hi. Today I encountered this problem as well. However, changing the engine name to 6.2.3 was not enough for me. Nor was the solution suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40383323/cant-accept-license-agreement-android-sdk-platform-2448.

What I did was download Android Studio. Then I updated the SDK version using the SDK manager provided by Android Studio (Tools/Android/SDK Manager). In the Android SDK Location click on the Edit button. There I was prompted with the option to update to API 27.

After updating, I created a new dummy android project (empty activity). After the project was created, the TODO console gave me the option to download the missing sdk components. There I was prompted with the ‘Accept licence’ popup. After accepting, I was able to build my ionic project without this error.
